# .NET DirectWrite Test Application

*This component is planned for future development.*

## Purpose

This .NET application will use native DirectWrite libraries to test emoji font rendering and identify compatibility issues. It will help debug why some Windows applications render emoji incorrectly even after font conversion.

## Planned Features

- 🔍 **DirectWrite API Testing**: Use native DirectWrite to render emoji
- 📊 **Font Validation**: Test converted fonts against DirectWrite requirements
- 🐛 **Issue Detection**: Identify specific compatibility problems
- 📋 **Detailed Reporting**: Generate reports on font rendering behavior
- 🎯 **Targeted Testing**: Test specific emoji ranges and sizes

## Technical Approach

The application will:

1. Load converted emoji fonts using DirectWrite APIs
2. Attempt to render various emoji characters
3. Compare results with expected behavior
4. Report any rendering failures or empty spaces
5. Provide detailed diagnostic information

## Development Status

**Status**: Not yet started

This component will be developed after the Python converter is fully stabilized and the monorepo structure is complete.

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to this component, please:

1. Check the main project issues for DirectWrite-related tasks
2. Familiarize yourself with DirectWrite APIs
3. Review the Python converter's DirectWrite compatibility fixes
4. Reach out to discuss implementation approach
